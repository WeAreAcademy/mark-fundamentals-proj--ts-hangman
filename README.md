You have learned how to read, extend and write code for a **JavaScript CLI game**. This means that you can also learn how to build a CLI in ***Type*Script**!

In this challenge, you will work out how an existing CLI game in TypeScript works, using the same ideas which you've been applying in Python and JavaScript: _variables_, _control flow_ and _functions_.

There are a couple of additional things that TypeScript adds to JavaScript (e.g. `interface`s and `type`s).

## Learning Outcomes

- Interpret code written by others
- Use variable declaration and assignment in TypeScript
- Use control flow in TypeScript
- Use functions and arguments in TypeScript
- Use search engines as a learning and knowledge aid
- Add code to a codebase written by others
- Constrain variables and arguments in TypeScript

## Exercise 1: Installing and demoing

**Success criterion:** playing a few games of Hangman on your local machine by running the TypeScript programme written.

Firstly, clone this repository to your local machine in some sensible place, for example:

```bash
cd ~/Development/Academy # or wherever you're organising everything
git clone https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-fundamentals-proj--ts-hangman.git
```

Then, change into the new directory and install the files:

```bash
cd mark-fundamentals-proj--ts-hangman
yarn
```

Finally, run the programme!

```bash
yarn start
```

## Exercise 2: Reading, understanding and documenting

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** a document which outlines how you think this TypeScript programme works. You don't have to achieve a theory which explains 100%, but you should strive to explain as much as possible.

(N.B.: The _correctness_ of your theory is **much less important** than the _process_ of forming this document. [Forming a prediction, and then discovering it was wrong, is an effective way to learn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959475217303468)!)

Steps that we have previously suggested as a learning exercise (and suggest again) include:

1. Take some time to read and digest the code
2. Google things that you don't understand
3. Experiment with changing things
4. Produce a narrative document

A good narrative document for this game would walk through at least one game of Hangman and explain how the programme code is leading to the terminal output. (Screenshots of the terminal and/or snippets of programme code are likely to be helpful here.)

## Exercise 3: TypeScript-specific notes

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** a document which outlines how this Hangman game uses some TypeScript features that don't exist in JavaScript.

The basic principles of variable assignment, control flow and functions are the same between TypeScript and JavaScript (and also Python).

TypeScript does introduce some additional things, though:

| Item | JavaScript example | TypeScript example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable declaration | <pre>let counter = 10</pre> | <pre>let counter: number = 10</pre> |
| Function declaration | <pre>function printCounterValue() { <br /> &nbsp;console.log(counter) <br /> }</pre> | <pre>function printCounterValue(): void { <br /> &nbsp;console.log(counter) <br />}</pre> |
| Parameter declaration | <pre>function incrementCounter(n) { <br /> &nbsp;counter += n; <br /> &nbsp;return counter; <br /> }</pre> | <pre>function incrementCounter(n: number): number { <br /> &nbsp;counter += n; <br /> &nbsp;return counter; <br /> }</pre> |
| Interfaces | N/A | <pre>interface FootballMatch { <br/>&nbsp;homeGoals: number; <br/>&nbsp;awayGoals: number; <br/>&nbsp;teamNames: string[], <br/>&nbsp;isFullTime: boolean <br/>}</pre> |
| Types | N/A | <pre>type FootballPosition = 'striker' <br/>&nbsp;&#124; 'midfielder' <br/>&nbsp;&#124; 'defender' <br/>&nbsp;&#124; 'goalkeeper'</pre> |
| Type Assertion | N/A | <pre>const substituteBench = [<br/>&nbsp;'goalkeeper', <br/>&nbsp;'defender', <br/>&nbsp;'defender', <br/>&nbsp;'midfielder', <br/>&nbsp;'midfielder', <br/>&nbsp;'striker' <br/>] as FootballPosition[]</pre> |

Produce a document which explains:

- How do each of these things work?
- How are they used in the Hangman project?

If you are a bit baffled by TypeScript, you might want to [try this 1 hour course](https://scrimba.com/learn/intrototypescript).

## Exercise 4: Check your understanding

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** a conversation with a Faculty member and amended comments.

Talk to a member of Faculty about your understanding of the game and of TypeScript.

Amend your notes for any important points that come out of the conversation.

## Exercise 5: Extend the game

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** a game which can be playtested and which satisfies the specified requirements for each extension.

### Extension 1: Handle uppercase guesses

The game probably doesn't behave as a player would expect when they guess a letter in uppercase form.

Produce some acceptance criteria for a fix, and then try to implement a fix to pass those acceptance criteria.

(Acceptance criteria are really helpful here because there are at least two fundamentally different ways you could handle the user inputting an uppercase letter: require them to try again with a lowercase letter, or process the uppercase letter in a sensible way.)

### Extension 2: Hangman animation

The game currently prints out a slightly boring 'Lives remaining' message.

Can you extend the game so that an [ASCII stick person](https://www.google.com/search?q=ascii+stick+person&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMy62_nfHtAhVAQhUIHV4qD1QQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&biw=1536&bih=801) gets slowly assembled, like in the traditional whiteboard version of the game?

## Exercise 6: Commentary and reflection

**Success criterion:** documented reflections.
